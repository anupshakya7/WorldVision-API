2021,sub-Saharan Africa,Zimbabwe,Harare,EEE,"Over the past year, Zimbabwe has endured health challenges, climate extremes, and political tensions, leaving many vulnerable families in need on several fronts.

A severe cholera outbreak began in February of 2023, impacting 10 provinces across the country. This epidemic remains a high concern for many communities. In addition, extreme dry spells have heightened food insecurity for the country, and hunger and malnutrition are on the rise. After an election year in 2023, political tensions have delayed humanitarian efforts in some regions.

In response, World Vision has been addressing immediate needs, equipping communities with medical tents, medicines, and various equipment to serve patients dealing with cholera. Cholera guidelines were also distributed across six different districts to help build staff capacity. In an effort to combat food insecurity, World Vision implemented a “Lean Season Assistance” program, aiding communities in their food distribution. Dedicated staff and partners in Zimbabwe continue to help empower communities toward self-sufficiency for lasting impact.",https://www.worldvision.org/our-work/country-profiles/zimbabwe,Urbanisation,Housing
